# FriendFinder

This is a web application made for the UNCC coding bootcamp. The purpose of the app is to act as a basic friend matcher, where you will answer 10 questions and your answers will be compared to other users scores and the user with the least deviation from your selections will be displayed as the best match. 

You can find the app deployed on Heroku: https://damp-shore-79559.herokuapp.com/
